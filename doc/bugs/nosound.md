# Mechvibes++ Known Issues

## No Sound on Keypress

If you are not getting any sound feedback from Mechvibes++, chances are that whatever application you are running is running as Administrator. Therefore, the application is practically blocking Mechvibes from running.

### To fix this, you can do two things:

- Run Mechvibes++ as Administrator
	- It should ask for this upon startup. Skipping this prompt will still let the app run but may lead to problems like what you may be having.

- Quit the application, and run it normally.
