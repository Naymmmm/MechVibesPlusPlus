# Mechvibes++ FAQ

## How do I make Mechvibes++ go through my microphone?

You can use [VoiceMeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) to do this. Please look up another guide if you can't figure out how to set this up yourself.

Please also know that VoiceMeeter is not our software and we can't help with issues for it.

## How do I get this on Linux/macOS?

You'll need to compile a version yourself. Please see this [guide](linux-and-mac.md).
